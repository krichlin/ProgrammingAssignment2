## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your

## Write a short comment describing this function

## makeCacheMatrix is a function used in Programming Assignment 2
## This function accepts a matrix as an input, and 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}







## This should really go into its own separate file, but let's leave it here for the moment
## cacheSolve is a function that "solves" a matrix, ie, mathematically inverts the matrix.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
     
     
  ## A matrix needs to be square to be inverted.  The first thing we should do is to check this.
  ## However the assignment doesn't require it, so I've left this part commented out.  
     
  ##   is_square <- ## is it square?  save result as logical     
  ##   if !(is_square) { throw an error }
  ##   else if {   ## otherwise go through with the calculation to determine the inverse. }
         
         
     
}
